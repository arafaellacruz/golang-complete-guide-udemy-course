//--Summary:
//  Create a program that can perform dice rolls using various configurations
//  of number of dice, number of rolls, and number of sides on the dice.
//  The program should report the results as detailed in the requirements.
//
//--Requirements:

//* Print additional information in these circumstances:
//  - "Snake eyes": when the total roll is 2, and total dice is 2
//  - "Lucky 7": when the total roll is 7
//  - "Even": when the total roll is even
//  - "Odd": when the total roll is odd
//* The program must use variables to configure:
//
//--Notes:
//* Use packages from the standard library to complete the project
//* Try using different values for your variables to check the results

package main

func main() {
	//* Print the sum of the dice roll
	d1 := 1
	d2 := 2
	sum := d1 + d2

	//  - number of times to roll the dice
	timesToRoll := 2

	//  - number of dice used in the rolls
	numberOfDices := 2

	//  - number of sides of all the dice (6-sided, 10-sided, etc determined
	//    with a variable). All dice must use the same variable for number
	//    of sides, so they all have the same number of sides.
	numberOfSides := 6

	if
